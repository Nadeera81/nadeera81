        <h3>Things to do in Sri Lanka</h3>
        <ol>
            <li id="to-do">Join pilgrims on Adam’s Peak</li>
            <p id="to-do-para">Adam’s Peak has been a pilgrimage site for over a thousand years. Its cloud-piercing crest is one of Sri Lanka’s most recognisable natural landmarks. This is partly thanks to what lies on its summit: the Sri Pada, or Sacred Footprint. The footprint is an indent in the rock believed by Buddhists to be the footprint of the Buddha himself.</p>
            <li id="to-do">Wander between tea plantations</li>
            
            <p id="to-do-para"> Is there a greener place than Ella? No matter where you’ll look, all you’ll see is tea. Set deep in the highlands between verdant hills cloaked with tea plantations, this is rural Sri Lanka at its most glorious.</p>
            
            <li id="to-do">Find blue whales</li>
            <p id="to-do-para"> Sri Lanka is a real hotspot for whale-watching, and it’s one of the only places on the planet where you can reliably spot blue whales, the biggest of them all. Join the flotilla of guided tours departing from the idyllic coastal town of Mirissa on Sri Lanka’s southern tip, and you’ll sail down past Dondra Head into the deeper waters above the continental shelf.</p>
